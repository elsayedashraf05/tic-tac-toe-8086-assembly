## 📌 Overview

This project implements a complete two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game in pure 8086 Assembly language. It runs on the **MTS-86C 8086 Microcomputer Trainer Kit** and uses three real hardware peripherals simultaneously:

| Peripheral | Role |
|---|---|
| **8279 Keypad** | Player input (keys 1–9 mapped to board cells) |
| **RS-232 Terminal** (Tera Term) | Board display, prompts, and game messages |
| **HD44780 LCD** | Win/Draw announcement on the kit's LCD screen |
| **8255 Port B LEDs** | Rotating LED celebration on player win |

## 🎮 How to Play

The 3×3 board is numbered 1–9:

```
  +-------+-------+-------+
  |       |       |       |
  |   1   |   2   |   3   |
  |       |       |       |
  +-------+-------+-------+
  |       |       |       |
  |   4   |   5   |   6   |
  |       |       |       |
  +-------+-------+-------+
  |       |       |       |
  |   7   |   8   |   9   |
  |       |       |       |
  +-------+-------+-------+
```

- **Player 1** plays as `X`, **Player 2** plays as `O`
- Press the corresponding key on the kit keypad to place your symbol
- First player to get **3 in a row** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins
- If all 9 cells are filled with no winner, the game is a **Draw**

## 🧩 Subroutines

| Subroutine | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DRAW_BOARD` | Prints the current 3×3 board to Tera Term, interleaving live `GRID[]` values with frame strings |
| `CHECK_WIN` | Checks all 8 winning lines (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals) for the current player. Returns `AL=1` on win |
| `LCD_WAIT` | Polls LCD status port bit 7 (Busy Flag) until the controller is ready |
| `LCD_CMD_WRITE` | Sends a command byte to the LCD (waits for ready first) |
| `LCD_DAT_WRITE` | Sends a character byte to LCD display RAM |
| `LCD_WIN_MSG` | Initialises LCD and writes `PLAYER X WINS` + `CONGRATULATIONS!` across 2 lines |
| `LCD_DRAW_MSG` | Initialises LCD and writes `** DRAW GAME!! **` + `WELL PLAYED!` across 2 lines |
| `HARDWARE_OUTPUT` | Rotates a single lit LED left across all 8 LEDs in an infinite loop (win celebration) |

---

## 💾 Data Segment

| Label | Size | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GRID` | 9 bytes | Board cells — initialised `'1'`–`'9'`, overwritten with `'X'`/`'O'` on moves |
| `PLAYER` | 1 byte | Current player symbol (`'X'` starts first) |
| `MOVES` | 1 byte | Move counter (0–9); draw detected when it reaches 9 |
| `MSG_WELCOME` | string | Welcome banner printed at startup |
| `MSG_TOP/SEP/ROW` | strings | Board frame fragments interleaved with live cell values |
| `LCD_STR_*` | strings | Null-terminated strings written to LCD |

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

### Requirements
- MTS-86C 8086 Microcomputer Trainer Kit
- MASM or compatible 8086 assembler
- Tera Term (or any RS-232 terminal at the kit's baud rate)

### Steps

**1. Assemble the source file:**
```
MASM working_with_blinking.ASM;
LINK working_with_blinking.OBJ;
```

**2. Transfer the binary to the MTS-86C kit** via the kit's monitor upload utility.

**3. Execute from address `0000H`** using the kit monitor's `G` (Go) command:
```
G 0000
```

**4. Open Tera Term** connected to the kit's RS-232 port to see the board and interact.

> **Tip:** The keypad scan codes map as: key `1` → `00H`, key `2` → `01H`, ..., key `9` → `08H`. The program converts these to ASCII `'1'`–`'9'` internally.

## 🛠️ Key Implementation Details

**Keypad polling (non-blocking loop):**  
The program reads the 8279 Status Register at `FFEAH` and checks bit 0 (FIFO Data Available). It spins in `KBD_POLL` until a key is pressed, then reads the scan code from the Data Register at `FFE8H`.

**RAM/Storage layout:**  
All data is placed after the last `ENDP` directive in the same code segment (`CS = DS`). The stack is initialised to `4000H` to avoid overlapping the program and data area.

**LCD busy-wait:**  
Every LCD command and data write is preceded by a `LCD_WAIT` call that polls bit 7 of the LCD Status port. This ensures no bytes are dropped even when the LCD is processing a clear-display command (which takes ~1.5ms).

**LED rotation:**  
`HARDWARE_OUTPUT` uses `ROL AL, 1` to rotate a single set bit left through all 8 bits — producing the classic chasing-light effect — with a software delay loop between each step.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The program does **not** return to DOS after a win — it loops the LED animation forever. Reset the kit to restart.
- The `BLINK_COUNT` constant in the source is a legacy label kept for reference; the actual LED loop is controlled by `CX` inside `HARDWARE_OUTPUT`.
- Input validation rejects all keypad scan codes above `08H` with an `INVALID_INPUT` branch that re-prints the prompt.
